# Panel State Configuration
# This file stores the state of all open panels and is automatically updated
# when you navigate or change panel settings during runtime

# Example panel configurations (uncomment and modify as needed):
# [[panels]]
# root_path = "/Users/username/Documents"
# sort_column = "name"
# sort_ascending = true
#
# [[panels]]
# root_path = "/Users/username/Downloads"
# sort_column = "date"
# sort_ascending = false

# Currently no panels saved - will be populated on first run
